Adobe Source Libraries
=====

This started out as a fork from Adobe's original ASL Perforce server, but has since been undergoing development. Please contact the project owners if you have any questions or comments.

Build Status: [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/stlab/adobe_source_libraries.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stlab/adobe_source_libraries)
=====

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/stlab/adobe_source_libraries) to validate ASL's build state. A build consists of building the test suite with Boost bjam in both debug and release modes.

Documentation
=====
ASL's documentation is built with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) and [hosted on GitHub](http://stlab.github.io/adobe_source_libraries/). We are in the process of updating the documentation so please pardon the dust.
